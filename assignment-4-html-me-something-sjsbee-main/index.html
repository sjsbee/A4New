               <b>Crusader Kings III</b> is an management roleplaying game released in 2020. Over the course of the game you play the ruler of an area from cradle to grave, and eventually play the descendants of these character for as long as you can keep your head on your shoulders. Rather than talking about myself, I thought it would be more interesting to make a character page for one of the rulers in my first game.

               Hoodo of House Leelkase was the daughter of Ughazad XXXXX. XXXXX was married to YYYYYY, ruler of ZZZZZZ. Despite their marriage the two rulers remained in different countries. 
               The first five children from this union remained in ZZZZZZ with YYYYYY, as the children were to receive lands from their father (or mother) because of confederate partition.
               ZZZZZZZ died in MM/DD/YYYY, and by right each of the five children inherited 1/5 of their father's lands.
               In Sanag, XXXXX found out that her long-term affair resulted in a child, Hoodo. 
               As this child was publicly born of union outside of the union with her husband, Hoodo was raised by her mother in Sanag, and was the only heir to inherit the Sanag lands.
